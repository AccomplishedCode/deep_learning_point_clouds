# Deep Learning on Point Clouds

Hi! This project is a Pytorch + Open3D implementation of PointNet. Please note that this implementation does not use Torch Points 3D, however I'm very excited to use it in my next project where I'll use it to classify objects from point clouds scanned on the street using Terrestrial Scanners. 

## About the data

The data used here is the Shapenet dataset released by Stanford. The link for that is below:

## Pretrained Weights

The pretrained weights for the trained model are in the cls folder. In the notebook, you can train the model and store the weights yourself, as well as load the pretrained weights to try out the classification yourself! 

## Results

Below are the results for the model presented in this notebook.
